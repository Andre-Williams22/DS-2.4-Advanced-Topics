# DS 1.1: Data Analysis & Visualization

## Course Description

Learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization with modern tools and libraries.
Master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories with discoveries and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights.
Collect a dataset, explore, analyze, and visualize it to discover trends, then present original insights.
Gain a strong grounding in statistical concepts including measures of center and spread, distributions, sampling, and the central limit theorem.
Utilize statistical techniques to calculate z-scores and confidence intervals, perform hypothesis tests, and identify outliers.
