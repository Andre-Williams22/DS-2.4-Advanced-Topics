## Class Assignments

### Seminars

Each student will complete an **individual comprehensive project** on an advanced Data Science topic, and will present their findings to the class in a seminar format.

 **Part 1** Study and explore your chosen topic and present your work to the class

Your class presentation will answer the following questions

- What is the problem you chose to address?
- What data set did you use?
- What model did you use to solve the problem?
- How did you transform the data in order to prepare it for the modeling step?

**Part 2** Further explore your chosen topic and present your findings to the class

​	This exploration can involve either

* Improving your existing model, or 

* Comparing the chosen methodology with another way of tackling the problem.

### Projects

Your explorations from Parts 1 and 2 will become your Final Project, which will be a part of your Data Science portfolio.

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required assignments
