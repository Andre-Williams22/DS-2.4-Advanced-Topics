# Advanced-Topics-In-Data-Science

## Course Description

This course covers popular advanced machine learning and deep learning concepts including recommendation systems (RS) and Deep RS, Bayesian networks, probabilistic graphical models, natural language processing (NLP), LSTM neural networks, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and advanced computer vision (Unet). Students complete individual comprehensive projects in one of the topic areas and present their findings in a seminar format.

### Why you should know this

All of the models and algorithms learning in this course, are extensively use them. Also, students will choose one topic they like the most and dive deeper into it while learn all other topics from classes and classmates

## Prerequisites:  

- [DS 2.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-2.2-Deep-Learning)


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to ...

1. Describe the Recommender System (RS) and the various methodologies in RS
1. Understand all components in NLP, including Bag-of-Word, TFIDF, Topic Modeling, Word2Vec
1. Learn, build, and gain inference from a probabilistic graphical model
1. Generate computer images from GANs
1. Apply PageRank on a defined Network

## Schedule

**NOTE:** Due to the shorter summer sessions, for some class sessions you will see multiple topics covered. This is to ensure that we cover the same material that we normally would in non-summer terms.


**Course Dates:** Tuesday, May 28 – Tuesday, July 2, 2019 (6 weeks)

**Class Times:** Tuesday and Thursday at 3:30–5:20pm (11 class sessions)
